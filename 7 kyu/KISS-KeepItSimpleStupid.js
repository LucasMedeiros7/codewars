// [7 kyu] KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid

// Description:
// KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid. It is a design principle for keeping things simple rather than complex.
// You are the boss of Joe.
// Joe is submitting words to you to publish to a blog. He likes to complicate things.
// Define a function that determines if Joe's work is simple or complex.
// Input will be non emtpy strings with no punctuation.

// Examples: 
// It is simple if: the length of each word does not exceed the amount of words in the string (See example test cases)
// Otherwise it is complex.
// If complex:
// return "Keep It Simple Stupid"
// or if it was kept simple:
// return "Good work Joe!"
// Note: Random test are random and nonsensical. Here is a silly example of a random test:
// "jump always mostly is touchy dancing choice is pineapples mostly"

// Solution:
function isKiss(words) {
  const KISS =
    words.split(' ').filter(word => word.length > words.split(' ').length)
      .length === 0;
  return KISS ? 'Good work Joe!' : 'Keep It Simple Stupid';
